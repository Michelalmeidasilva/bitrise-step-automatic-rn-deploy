  Automatic react-native android deploy.
summary: |
    This step aims to automate the Android processes of building, testing, and deploying a React Native application.
description: |
More details:
React Native is a popular framework for building mobile apps that allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.
However, building and deploying React Native apps on Android can be a complex process that requires configuring multiple tools and platforms.
This step helps streamline that process by automating the build, test, and deployment steps for Android.
It can be integrated into a bitrise workflow to automatically trigger these steps whenever there is a change in the codebase, ensuring that the app is always up-to-date and working as expected.
The step may include tasks such as installing dependencies, running tests, compiling the code, and generating the APK for deployment.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
# https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_docs/step-development-guideline.md
#
# project_type_tags:
#   - ios
#   - macos
#   - android
#   - xamarin
#   - react-native
#   - cordova
#   - ionic
#   - flutter

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.
